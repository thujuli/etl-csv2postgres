## ETL Process from CSV to PostgreSQL Database

This README serves as a summary of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for moving data from a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database. For a comprehensive explanation and implementation details, please refer to the associated [Medium article](https://medium.com/@thujuli/mastering-etl-integrating-csv-data-into-an-olap-database-with-pandas-60de05604ea9).

### Instructions

**Extract Data**: The tool or library used for this purpose is Pandas, to read and extract data from the CSV file.

**Transform Data**: Modify and shape the extracted data as needed for your specific use case, for example, data type conversions, data validation, or filtering.

**Load Data**: Establish a connection to your PostgreSQL database, create a table to match your data, and insert the transformed data into the table using SQL statements.
